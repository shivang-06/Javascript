###Spotify Automation
*This is a browser automation script that automates spotify and adds multiple albums to a user's library.
*The script requires credentials of the user and a file with names of all the albums user need to save in their library.
*This script also creates a JSON file which lists all the songs in the albums added to the user's list.
